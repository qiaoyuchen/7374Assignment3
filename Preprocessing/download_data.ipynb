Toland -- President and CEO\", \"16:\", \"Thank you, Judy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Since our last call, Corindus has made significant progress on several important fronts. The fourth quarter of 2018 proved to be our best to date, reflecting what we believe is the beginning of an industry shift to embrace robotic intervention and indications of a longer term commitment to commercializing remote capabilities.\", \"17:\", \"Let me share some highlights with you now. Revenue was $4.7 million up from $3.1 million in Q3. We installed six new CorPath GRX systems and performed one system upgrade during the quarter, bringing the total installed base up to 52 systems. We sold 522 cassettes in Q4, a 15% increase over last year, a number we expect to continue to grow as many of the new and existing robotic programs ramp up.\", \"18:\", \"We've also expanded our global footprint with new system installations in India and Singapore. In addition, we received our first European order from the Clinique Pasteur in Toulouse, France.\", \"19:\", \"Finally on the international front, our Class A-1 reimbursement listing was granted by the Japanese government on March 5, which will allow us to start our post-market approval trial in Japan. Our global expansion strategy is working, and we expect more purchases in 2019.\", \"20:\", \"Exciting things are also happening on our research and development front. In December, we successfully completed the world's first in-human remote PCI study in India, a significant milestone for our remote robotic program. In 2018, we completed our preclinical remote work at TCT live case demonstration and all five cases for our first in-human remote PCI trial, all of which has driven significant interest from the clinical community on the future robotics and liability of robotic program now is important.\", \"21:\", \"In fact, a leading US hospital recently placed an order to become a core development site for telerobotic capabilities. I'll tell you more about that shortly. And just a few weeks ago, in mid-February, we submitted for pre-market clearance of our neurovascular indication for CorPath GRX with the FDA. Clearance to treat neurovascular conditions, which could come as early as this summer, would be a significant step in transforming the current standard of care for stroke patients.\", \"22:\", \"To support these activities, we strengthened our cash position through a $19.5 million (ph) private placement in Q1, with a large institutional investor and existing shareholders. The proceeds will allow us to fund ongoing growth, enable us to pursue new products and capabilities. At the same time, we remain actively engaged with Citi to advance partnership discussions to co-develop and commercialize a neurovascular robotic platform with remote capabilities.\", \"23:\", \"Against this backdrop, let me begin with the robotics business. Following the TCT Conference, where robotics was at the forefront, the selling cycle for our technology accelerated with select customers. There appears to be an increased sense of urgency within the clinical community to establish robotic programs. Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for instance, a very busy Top 20 research facility in the US, widely considered a thought leader and a premier provider of cardiac services, purchased a CorPath GRX system in less than 10 weeks.\", \"24:\", \"We're seeing this trend hold in the first quarter as well. HCA, one of the leading providers of healthcare services in the country, purchased its first robot in a transaction that closed within 60 days. What's particularly exciting about this sale is that it opens the door to roughly 185 hospitals in the HCA network that can potentially purchase our technology. We expect to see momentum build as we move through 2019 from both a sales perspective and with regard to utilization. The University of Washington performed a 100 cases in its first five months. Our Singapore site recently launched and performed 20 cases in its first month. And OhioHealth Riverside in Columbus, Ohio is now doing both peripheral and coronary robotic procedures. In fact, using CorPath GRX, they recently became the first hospital in Ohio to perform robotic assisted treatment of peripheral artery disease.\", \"25:\", \"We are currently preparing a dossier to the FDA for a next wave of automation, which we call the technIQ Series. Designed to speed up cases and increase procedural success in some of the most complex PCI cases, we're working on a digital (ph) four movements that we call smart procedural automation or (inaudible). By that, I mean we would be able to take the best physicians hands from all across the world, automate their movements and put them in a robot so that physicians anywhere in the world have the same capabilities to the use of our system.\", \"26:\", \"As doctors and hospitals around the world increasingly embrace robotics, we will continue to enhance the capabilities of our technology, expanding our global footprint, and we'll be poised to build a very strong platform for growth with CorPath.\", \"27:\", \"With this in mind, the big news for Corindus in Q4 was the success of the world's first ever human remote intervention performed in India using the CorPath technology. In December, internationally renowned surgeon Dr. Tejas Patel, Chairman and Chief Interventional Cardiologist of the Apex Heart Institute, successfully conducted the first in-human telerobotics coronary intervention. Notably, as part of the study we completed five successful remote procedures from a distance of 20 miles away.\", \"28:\", \"This study represents the world's first percutaneous coronary intervention conducted from a remote location outside of the cath lab. The success of this study paves the way for large-scale, long-distance telerobotic procedures around the world, ultimately providing access to highly specialized and timely cardiovascular care to multiple patient populations anywhere, anytime.\", \"29:\", \"Importantly, during these procedures, we validated that we have solved for any potential mechanical latency issues. There was no discernible delayed reaction from physician movement to device movement over the 20-mile distance. What we plan to do next with our remote technology ties into revenue. The value proposition of remote procedures is compelling for both doctors and hospitals. For time to treat patients like stroke victims, it would allow patient to be treated by a specialist from any hospital, what we call hub and spoke model, and the impact on the time to treat these patients, would be significantly enhanced.\", \"30:\", \"In addition, remote procedures could be in the four walls of their hospital by allowing a physician to do multiple cases in a command control center like model. This enables doctors to maximize the efficiency of their day which could give him the ability to do multiple cases back to back, without any downtime. Hospitals likewise, could increase their throughput by performing more procedures in a day. At the forefront of this value proposition is Houston Methodist Hospital, which placed a significant order in Q4 to become a core development site for telerobotics. On that pathway, Houston Methodist will eventually become the first institution in the world to have telerobotic capabilities for interventional procedures across multiple disease states. This recent purchase is a notable outcome from the success of our remote clinical cases in India and confirms our belief that our technology has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of vascular disease by making specialized, timely medical care available to patients, regardless of their location.\", \"31:\", \"We believe robotics applications and opportunities ultimately for remote, are extensive. In peripheral procedures for example, patients wouldn't have to travel for elective peripheral treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of amputations. For PCI, patients could be treated by the best physicians in the world, and in neurovascular, a remote therapeutic option applies to one the biggest unmet needs in healthcare, faster stroke treatment times, for best patient outcomes and recovery.\", \"32:\", \"So by demonstrating a remote technology solution with the success of the world's first telerobotic interventional procedures in humans and defining a path to build revenue, we believe we have a one-two punch for success.\", \"33:\", \"Turning to our neuro program, we're continuing to build a strategy to solve remote access to care and time to treat for stroke. Among stroke survivors, about two-thirds live with disabilities that could have been prevented with appropriate earlier treatment. Ultimately, our goal is to enable physicians to deliver treatment for ischemic stroke through through a hub and spoke model that extends their reach to patient populations across the globe, speeding up time to treatment by enabling physician to conduct a procedure from virtually anywhere could revolutionize patient outcomes.\", \"34:\", \"As part of this goal, we submitted our dossier for 510(k) review for our neuro indication with the FDA on February 14th. If FDA clearance is granted, possibly as early as this summer, we could potentially be selling robots for neuro by year end for the treatment of aneurysms and stroke. The neuro indication has also garnered a lot of interest from the clinical community. At our headquarters in Boston, we are currently hosting one to two neuro VIP visits per week. Physicians are coming away with nothing but positive feedback around automation, procedural safety, and precision movements. They want to build and improve their own robotic skill sets in their comprehensive stroke centers. To fully realize the potential of a neurovascular solution, we're actively pursuing a partnership deal. As disclosed previously, we engaged Citigroup to help us evaluate the strong interest we have received from potential partners.\", \"35:\", \"We believe that there are three elements to successful partnership, core developing, cross-selling and funding, and we will carefully consider our options to ensure that we collaborate with the right partner and in the right way. We know that hospitals are starting to budget for this in their institutions. Given the high level of clinical interest, potential FDA clearance for a neurovascular indication by the summer of this year and a potential partnership deal, we believe the neuro indication could be a 2019 event in the US and be reflected in our performance this year.\", \"36:\", \"Robotics has the potential to fundamentally change the paradigm of how patients are treated. We believe we're now beginning to see a real shift in support of the technology. What's really exciting it is that by the end of this year, we expect to be able to provide physicians with the robotic tools necessary to treat the entire body, from head to toe.\", \"37:\", \"There are multiple upcoming milestones this year that will continue to drive the business forward. Number one, receiving FDA clearance of CorPath GRX for neurovascular applications. Number two, submission of the next wave of CorPath GRX automation to the FDA for clearance. Number three, a planned US trial for remote intervention. Number four, completing a potential partnership to co-develop and commercialize a neurovascular robot. Number five, completing proof of principle for a remote stroke robotic system. And as we advance these initiatives, we'll continue to be prudent about how we use our cash, a record low cash burn of $2.1 million per month in Q4, reflects our commitment to actively managing our resources.\", \"38:\", \"The recent financing validates our efforts as we pursue the compelling opportunities in neuro and remote robotics, with the goal of extending the reach of the highly skilled physicians to areas where access to specialized healthcare is limited and time to treatment is critical. We hope to have more to share about the potential strategic partnership with the funding component for the company. A portion of which we expect to be non-dilutive very shortly.\", \"39:\", \"With that, I will turn the call over to David Long to review our financial results in more detail. David?\", \"40:\", \"David Long -- Chief Financial Officer\", \"41:\", \"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 totaled $4.7 million compared to $4.2 million in the same period of the prior year. The revenue increase is due primarily to increased volume and average selling price on systems sold, partially offset by lower system upgrade revenue.\", \"42:\", \"During Q4, we installed six new CorPath GRX systems and performed one system upgrade, increasing the installed base of CorPath GRX to 52 units. We sold 522 cassettes in Q4, up 15% year over year. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $1.9 million compared to a gross profit of $1.2 million in the prior year period.\", \"43:\", \"SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $6.6 million, compared to $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to cost controls, reallocation of spending toward technology development, and timing of certain tradeshow costs. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $2.6 million compared to $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\", \"44:\", \"The increase was primarily due to increased headcount investments, development costs and clinical spending, partially offset by research grant reimbursements. We have been actively managing our cash burn at $2.1 million per month for the quarter compared to $2.3 million per month in the prior year -- quarter (ph) and $2.9 million per month in Q4 of 2017.\", \"45:\", \"We had a record low burn rate reflecting our commitment to the ongoing management of our resources. Loss from operations for the period totaled $7.3 million compared to an operating loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss totaled $7.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss per share, basic and diluted, was $0.04, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2017. We ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with $23.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, and in Q1, we completed a $19.8 million gross private placement, providing us with additional financial flexibility toward funding our programs.\", \"46:\", \"With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark.\", \"47:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"48:\", \"Thank you, David. Let me close with a brief anecdote that I believe illustrates where we are headed and why our technology resonates with physicians and investors alike. As I mentioned before, we recently installed a system in Singapore. The physician was in one room and the patient was in another. Our controls were in a control room that allowed the physician to do the procedure in their street clothes, and the picture noted from the physician in quotes, this is the first percutaneous coronary interventions I've ever performed in my career wearing street clothes. Our technology, we believe, holds the potential to change the future of medicine, and that's an example of that. As always, we appreciate your support, and we continue -- as we continue to expand our capabilities as the worldwide leader in vascular robotics.\", \"49:\", \"I'll now open the call up for questions. Operator?\", \"50:\", \"Operator\", \"51:\", \"(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. Your line is open.\", \"52:\", \"Unidentified Participant --  -- Analyst\", \"53:\", \"Hey, it's Drew on for Rick. Congratulations on the quarter, and I just wanted to start with Mark, you highlighted a lot of critical milestones in remote and neuro, especially being able to cover potentially all the interventions by year end. And you talked about momentum and accelerating the sales cycle. So I guess my question is, with all the positive pieces at Corindus, how will that kind of translate into commercial sales in 2019? And you previously talked about leads being kind of in that 150 range, maybe how has that changed over the past three months? And I'll just lump this last one in here too, but I mean, would you be disappointed if you were to end 2019 with less than 100 systems on the install base?\", \"54:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"55:\", \"Yeah. Hey, Drew, thanks for the questions. Very good questions and we are thrilled with the milestones that we have achieved and the shortened sales cycle, which speaks to what I call the burning platform of why you need to get into robotics today, and I think that physicians are starting to see the critical need of that across multiple fronts. Obviously, we've had most of our cases performed in PCI. We've got four programs up and running for peripheral and we've got a neurovascular ahead of us here in 2019. We really see the growth of this Company driven off of the backs of of exactly that concept around telerobotics and the future of telerobotics is no longer a 10-year Star Wars discussion. It's much more near term. We've demonstrated in our pre-clinical studies. We've demonstrated in humans, and we're anticipating it driving a lot of behavior of physicians wanting to become robotic experts in their own lab, in their own hospital before they start to do remote procedures in 2020 and beyond.\", \"56:\", \"So we're starting to see that transfer into sales. Obviously, we saw that in Q4 post TCT with our success of demonstrating a live case at TCT that has spurt on a lot of the clinical interest. And so, when we think about the upcoming year, we get very bullish about the growth trajectory for us, driven off of the excitement around where our robotics is going from telerobotics standpoint as well as global expansion is another key category for us that we continue to put a lot of emphasis on. We placed another system at India. We placed another -- we stood up Singapore. We just got our first order in Europe and in a key center in France. We got -- we just got approval recently in Australia. We're starting to launch in the Nordics. We are starting to launch in the UK. So we we feel like the international expansion is a big opportunity for us.\", \"57:\", \"And then, we think about the indication expansion sometime this summer in the neurovascular space. We look at that as a force multiplier for growth. So we would be excited about the number of leads we have because we have previously publicly said we have 150 or so leads that we were working on. I would say that continues to grow. We've got the neurovascular leads that continue to come in. As I mentioned in the call, we do approximately one to two VIP visits per week on neurovascular to get them up to speed on our technology. And I would anticipate that continuing to grow.\", \"58:\", \"As we think about the number of installations to close out 2019, I would anticipate us being close to 100 range, maybe a bit -- a little bit less than that in terms of future projections, but yeah, we closed out 2018 with 52 installations globally, but I think indication expansion, telerobotics and a greater international penetration will only help accelerate that.\", \"59:\", \"Drew Ranieri -- Stifel -- Analyst\", \"60:\", \"Thanks so much. And just you touched a little bit on this -- on international, but one thing that really caught our eye was the first European order. So can you just maybe go into a little bit more detail of how you see the European opportunity specifically for PCI, peripheral and neurovascular in days to come.\", \"61:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"62:\", \"Yeah, as I've mentioned previously, we haven't spent a lot of time in Europe, mostly because it's just a high cost burden on organizations to go into Europe because it's multiple different laws and regulations and how you get access into capital funding, but what we've seen is, we've seen an increased interest in robotics in Europe and funding sources are coming from foundational elements where -- or you have philanthropy donating the capital and then the institution acquires the capital, start to build out the robotic programs.\", \"63:\", \"And we have recently launched in -- or are launching in France right now, all right. We think that the interest level in Europe is continuing to grow for vascular robotics driven off of a lot of the work we're doing in automation, remote, as well as neurovascular. There's a significant interest in remote stroke treatment in Europe since they're a socialized medicine model, the disability cost of stroke management is a significant cost burden on their government. So they really see this as an increasing value proposition that's going to continue to grow.\", \"64:\", \"Drew Ranieri -- Stifel -- Analyst\", \"65:\", \"Great, thanks for the color, Mark.\", \"66:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"67:\", \"Thanks, Drew.\", \"68:\", \"Operator\", \"69:\", \"(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen of Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.\", \"70:\", \"Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst\", \"71:\", \"Hi, Mark and David. How are you?\", \"72:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"73:\", \"Hey, Jeff.\", \"74:\", \"Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst\", \"75:\", \"Hey, I wanted to (inaudible), firstly, could you talk a little bit about the changes or differences, modifications for the neuro indication and how that progressed as far as the application to the FDA?\", \"76:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"77:\", \"Sure. Good question, Jeff. So what we did in 2018 is we looked at our current system CorPath GRX, and the FDA currently looks at our approval process of are we compatible with devices or not? As you know, Jeff, we don't make anything that goes in the body. So we use currently approved FDA -- FDA-approved devices that we insert into the body for treatment and access.\", \"78:\", \"So, we needed to do some testing on the neuro devices, which we did that, completed that, and we made only slight modifications. It was great experience for us because we didn't have to completely reoutfit a robot for neurovascular. We're able to do minor changes to software and minor changes to our disposable, which is called a cassette. And those two things alone, provided us a high confidence that we have compatibility with all of the market leading neurovascular devices from all the companies that like the Medtronics, the Strykers, the Penumbras of the world. So that's what we used to submit into the FDA back on February 14.\", \"79:\", \"Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst\", \"80:\", \"Okay, got it. And you spoke a little bit about the US path to telerobotics and some of the movements at the technIQ software house and how does that relate to the RoR that you had before? And what specific files or applications will you have to get through or do you perceive getting through the FDA to get this added on as far as some of the software changes and movements?\", \"81:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"82:\", \"Yeah, great question. So automation, we really look at something that could speed procedures up considerably, particularly for the average operator that doesn't have the same skills as the expert. And as you know, with RoR or what we call Rotate on Retract, that was our first entree into automation, which showed a 53% reduction in wiring time for a physician. And with our submission back in late 2017 and approval subsequently after that in early 2018 for RoR. We established a -- I'll call it a pathway to regulatory approval for automation. We're essentially replicating that pathway with the additional four automated movements that we're submitting in to the FDA here soon, which we would anticipate being well received based upon what we learned in the early days of automation.\", \"83:\", \"So sometime this summer, we're going to have -- we view a kind of a library of algorithms that physician can choose -- could choose to provide them with some automation or smart procedural control that would allow them to complete procedures more efficiently and effectively and faster so that they could speed up their day as well as potentially even add more cases to their day. So we're really excited about that and believe that's going to be a continued driver of utilization for us as well.\", \"84:\", \"Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst\", \"85:\", \"Okay, got it. What's the specific approval process as you submit each specific movement or software modification algorithms?\", \"86:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"87:\", \"Yeah, it's a 510(k) submission and we we base it off of specs that we've already got defined within the FDA. And so it's -- should be a very smooth process for us as we're anticipating a well-received physician with the FDA on this.\", \"88:\", \"Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst\", \"89:\", \"Okay, got it, and then lastly, could you talk a little more about HCA? Maybe give us a little color on the geography of the hospital or perhaps some color on the number of physicians thus far that have been involved in the process or conducted cases?\", \"90:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"91:\", \"Yeah. So we mentioned HCA and the the account that we were able to install our first robotic system in that big IDN, obviously, the biggest one in the United States. I think it represents close to 5% of the US healthcare. Very exciting hospital. It was down in Texas. And as you know, HCA is predominantly in the southeast, but also nationally, but it represents a cornerstone of what we can build on with that healthcare system. As a matter of fact, they had a call with their corporate office earlier today as we are kind of plotting out the next steps we make within that healthcare organization.\", \"92:\", \"So moving in a really, really good path with a lot of these big integrated delivery networks that have multiple hospitals, and as they start to think about telerobotics, it could be a big benefit for them in a hub and spoke model when they've got hundreds of hospitals that they're trying to treat patients in and they don't have enough physicians to do it. So it can be a really compelling value proposition for these big IDNs that exist in the United States.\", \"93:\", \"Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst\", \"94:\", \"Okay, super. Thanks for taking the questions.\", \"95:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"96:\", \"Thanks, Jeff.\", \"97:\", \"Operator\", \"98:\", \"There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.\", \"99:\", \"Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO\", \"100:\", \"Great. Well, thanks for everybody who joined the call.

Since then, Corindus may have made announcements related to the topics discussed. So please reference the Company's most recent press releases and SEC filings.\", \"And with that, I'll turn the call over to Corindus's CEO, Mark Toland.\", 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', 'Thank you, Judy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Since our last call, Corindus has made significant progress on several important fronts. The fourth quarter of 2018 proved to be our best to date, reflecting what we believe is the beginning of an industry shift to embrace robotic intervention and indications of a longer term commitment to commercializing remote capabilities.', 'Let me share some highlights with you now. Revenue was $4.7 million up from $3.1 million in Q3. We installed six new CorPath GRX systems and performed one system upgrade during the quarter, bringing the total installed base up to 52 systems. We sold 522 cassettes in Q4, a 15% increase over last year, a number we expect to continue to grow as many of the new and existing robotic programs ramp up.', \"We've also expanded our global footprint with new system installations in India and Singapore. In addition, we received our first European order from the Clinique Pasteur in Toulouse, France.\", 'Finally on the international front, our Class A-1 reimbursement listing was granted by the Japanese government on March 5, which will allow us to start our post-market approval trial in Japan. Our global expansion strategy is working, and we expect more purchases in 2019.', \"Exciting things are also happening on our research and development front. In December, we successfully completed the world's first in-human remote PCI study in India, a significant milestone for our remote robotic program. In 2018, we completed our preclinical remote work at TCT live case demonstration and all five cases for our first in-human remote PCI trial, all of which has driven significant interest from the clinical community on the future robotics and liability of robotic program now is important.\", \"In fact, a leading US hospital recently placed an order to become a core development site for telerobotic capabilities. I'll tell you more about that shortly. And just a few weeks ago, in mid-February, we submitted for pre-market clearance of our neurovascular indication for CorPath GRX with the FDA. Clearance to treat neurovascular conditions, which could come as early as this summer, would be a significant step in transforming the current standard of care for stroke patients.\", 'To support these activities, we strengthened our cash position through a $19.5 million (ph) private placement in Q1, with a large institutional investor and existing shareholders. The proceeds will allow us to fund ongoing growth, enable us to pursue new products and capabilities. At the same time, we remain actively engaged with Citi to advance partnership discussions to co-develop and commercialize a neurovascular robotic platform with remote capabilities.', \"Against this backdrop, let me begin with the robotics business. Following the TCT Conference, where robotics was at the forefront, the selling cycle for our technology accelerated with select customers. There appears to be an increased sense of urgency within the clinical community to establish robotic programs. Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for instance, a very busy Top 20 research facility in the US, widely considered a thought leader and a premier provider of cardiac services, purchased a CorPath GRX system in less than 10 weeks.\", \"We're seeing this trend hold in the first quarter as well. HCA, one of the leading providers of healthcare services in the country, purchased its first robot in a transaction that closed within 60 days. What's particularly exciting about this sale is that it opens the door to roughly 185 hospitals in the HCA network that can potentially purchase our technology. We expect to see momentum build as we move through 2019 from both a sales perspective and with regard to utilization. The University of Washington performed a 100 cases in its first five months. Our Singapore site recently launched and performed 20 cases in its first month. And OhioHealth Riverside in Columbus, Ohio is now doing both peripheral and coronary robotic procedures. In fact, using CorPath GRX, they recently became the first hospital in Ohio to perform robotic assisted treatment of peripheral artery disease.\", \"We are currently preparing a dossier to the FDA for a next wave of automation, which we call the technIQ Series. Designed to speed up cases and increase procedural success in some of the most complex PCI cases, we're working on a digital (ph) four movements that we call smart procedural automation or (inaudible). By that, I mean we would be able to take the best physicians hands from all across the world, automate their movements and put them in a robot so that physicians anywhere in the world have the same capabilities to the use of our system.\", \"As doctors and hospitals around the world increasingly embrace robotics, we will continue to enhance the capabilities of our technology, expanding our global footprint, and we'll be poised to build a very strong platform for growth with CorPath.\", \"With this in mind, the big news for Corindus in Q4 was the success of the world's first ever human remote intervention performed in India using the CorPath technology. In December, internationally renowned surgeon Dr. Tejas Patel, Chairman and Chief Interventional Cardiologist of the Apex Heart Institute, successfully conducted the first in-human telerobotics coronary intervention. Notably, as part of the study we completed five successful remote procedures from a distance of 20 miles away.\", \"This study represents the world's first percutaneous coronary intervention conducted from a remote location outside of the cath lab. The success of this study paves the way for large-scale, long-distance telerobotic procedures around the world, ultimately providing access to highly specialized and timely cardiovascular care to multiple patient populations anywhere, anytime.\", 'Importantly, during these procedures, we validated that we have solved for any potential mechanical latency issues. There was no discernible delayed reaction from physician movement to device movement over the 20-mile distance. What we plan to do next with our remote technology ties into revenue. The value proposition of remote procedures is compelling for both doctors and hospitals. For time to treat patients like stroke victims, it would allow patient to be treated by a specialist from any hospital, what we call hub and spoke model, and the impact on the time to treat these patients, would be significantly enhanced.', 'In addition, remote procedures could be in the four walls of their hospital by allowing a physician to do multiple cases in a command control center like model. This enables doctors to maximize the efficiency of their day which could give him the ability to do multiple cases back to back, without any downtime. Hospitals likewise, could increase their throughput by performing more procedures in a day. At the forefront of this value proposition is Houston Methodist Hospital, which placed a significant order in Q4 to become a core development site for telerobotics. On that pathway, Houston Methodist will eventually become the first institution in the world to have telerobotic capabilities for interventional procedures across multiple disease states. This recent purchase is a notable outcome from the success of our remote clinical cases in India and confirms our belief that our technology has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of vascular disease by making specialized, timely medical care available to patients, regardless of their location.', \"We believe robotics applications and opportunities ultimately for remote, are extensive. In peripheral procedures for example, patients wouldn't have to travel for elective peripheral treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of amputations. For PCI, patients could be treated by the best physicians in the world, and in neurovascular, a remote therapeutic option applies to one the biggest unmet needs in healthcare, faster stroke treatment times, for best patient outcomes and recovery.\", \"So by demonstrating a remote technology solution with the success of the world's first telerobotic interventional procedures in humans and defining a path to build revenue, we believe we have a one-two punch for success.\", \"Turning to our neuro program, we're continuing to build a strategy to solve remote access to care and time to treat for stroke. Among stroke survivors, about two-thirds live with disabilities that could have been prevented with appropriate earlier treatment. Ultimately, our goal is to enable physicians to deliver treatment for ischemic stroke through through a hub and spoke model that extends their reach to patient populations across the globe, speeding up time to treatment by enabling physician to conduct a procedure from virtually anywhere could revolutionize patient outcomes.\", \"As part of this goal, we submitted our dossier for 510(k) review for our neuro indication with the FDA on February 14th. If FDA clearance is granted, possibly as early as this summer, we could potentially be selling robots for neuro by year end for the treatment of aneurysms and stroke. The neuro indication has also garnered a lot of interest from the clinical community. At our headquarters in Boston, we are currently hosting one to two neuro VIP visits per week. Physicians are coming away with nothing but positive feedback around automation, procedural safety, and precision movements. They want to build and improve their own robotic skill sets in their comprehensive stroke centers. To fully realize the potential of a neurovascular solution, we're actively pursuing a partnership deal. As disclosed previously, we engaged Citigroup to help us evaluate the strong interest we have received from potential partners.\", 'We believe that there are three elements to successful partnership, core developing, cross-selling and funding, and we will carefully consider our options to ensure that we collaborate with the right partner and in the right way. We know that hospitals are starting to budget for this in their institutions. Given the high level of clinical interest, potential FDA clearance for a neurovascular indication by the summer of this year and a potential partnership deal, we believe the neuro indication could be a 2019 event in the US and be reflected in our performance this year.', \"Robotics has the potential to fundamentally change the paradigm of how patients are treated. We believe we're now beginning to see a real shift in support of the technology. What's really exciting it is that by the end of this year, we expect to be able to provide physicians with the robotic tools necessary to treat the entire body, from head to toe.\", \"There are multiple upcoming milestones this year that will continue to drive the business forward. Number one, receiving FDA clearance of CorPath GRX for neurovascular applications. Number two, submission of the next wave of CorPath GRX automation to the FDA for clearance. Number three, a planned US trial for remote intervention. Number four, completing a potential partnership to co-develop and commercialize a neurovascular robot. Number five, completing proof of principle for a remote stroke robotic system. And as we advance these initiatives, we'll continue to be prudent about how we use our cash, a record low cash burn of $2.1 million per month in Q4, reflects our commitment to actively managing our resources.\", 'The recent financing validates our efforts as we pursue the compelling opportunities in neuro and remote robotics, with the goal of extending the reach of the highly skilled physicians to areas where access to specialized healthcare is limited and time to treatment is critical. We hope to have more to share about the potential strategic partnership with the funding component for the company. A portion of which we expect to be non-dilutive very shortly.', 'With that, I will turn the call over to David Long to review our financial results in more detail. David?', 'David Long -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 totaled $4.7 million compared to $4.2 million in the same period of the prior year. The revenue increase is due primarily to increased volume and average selling price on systems sold, partially offset by lower system upgrade revenue.', 'During Q4, we installed six new CorPath GRX systems and performed one system upgrade, increasing the installed base of CorPath GRX to 52 units. We sold 522 cassettes in Q4, up 15% year over year. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $1.9 million compared to a gross profit of $1.2 million in the prior year period.', 'SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $6.6 million, compared to $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to cost controls, reallocation of spending toward technology development, and timing of certain tradeshow costs. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $2.6 million compared to $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.', 'The increase was primarily due to increased headcount investments, development costs and clinical spending, partially offset by research grant reimbursements. We have been actively managing our cash burn at $2.1 million per month for the quarter compared to $2.3 million per month in the prior year -- quarter (ph) and $2.9 million per month in Q4 of 2017.', 'We had a record low burn rate reflecting our commitment to the ongoing management of our resources. Loss from operations for the period totaled $7.3 million compared to an operating loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss totaled $7.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss per share, basic and diluted, was $0.04, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2017. We ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with $23.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, and in Q1, we completed a $19.8 million gross private placement, providing us with additional financial flexibility toward funding our programs.', \"With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark.\", 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', \"Thank you, David. Let me close with a brief anecdote that I believe illustrates where we are headed and why our technology resonates with physicians and investors alike. As I mentioned before, we recently installed a system in Singapore. The physician was in one room and the patient was in another. Our controls were in a control room that allowed the physician to do the procedure in their street clothes, and the picture noted from the physician in quotes, this is the first percutaneous coronary interventions I've ever performed in my career wearing street clothes. Our technology, we believe, holds the potential to change the future of medicine, and that's an example of that. As always, we appreciate your support, and we continue -- as we continue to expand our capabilities as the worldwide leader in vascular robotics.\", \"I'll now open the call up for questions. Operator?\", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. Your line is open.', 'Unidentified Participant --  -- Analyst', \"Hey, it's Drew on for Rick. Congratulations on the quarter, and I just wanted to start with Mark, you highlighted a lot of critical milestones in remote and neuro, especially being able to cover potentially all the interventions by year end. And you talked about momentum and accelerating the sales cycle. So I guess my question is, with all the positive pieces at Corindus, how will that kind of translate into commercial sales in 2019? And you previously talked about leads being kind of in that 150 range, maybe how has that changed over the past three months? And I'll just lump this last one in here too, but I mean, would you be disappointed if you were to end 2019 with less than 100 systems on the install base?\", 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', \"Yeah. Hey, Drew, thanks for the questions. Very good questions and we are thrilled with the milestones that we have achieved and the shortened sales cycle, which speaks to what I call the burning platform of why you need to get into robotics today, and I think that physicians are starting to see the critical need of that across multiple fronts. Obviously, we've had most of our cases performed in PCI. We've got four programs up and running for peripheral and we've got a neurovascular ahead of us here in 2019. We really see the growth of this Company driven off of the backs of of exactly that concept around telerobotics and the future of telerobotics is no longer a 10-year Star Wars discussion. It's much more near term. We've demonstrated in our pre-clinical studies. We've demonstrated in humans, and we're anticipating it driving a lot of behavior of physicians wanting to become robotic experts in their own lab, in their own hospital before they start to do remote procedures in 2020 and beyond.\", \"So we're starting to see that transfer into sales. Obviously, we saw that in Q4 post TCT with our success of demonstrating a live case at TCT that has spurt on a lot of the clinical interest. And so, when we think about the upcoming year, we get very bullish about the growth trajectory for us, driven off of the excitement around where our robotics is going from telerobotics standpoint as well as global expansion is another key category for us that we continue to put a lot of emphasis on. We placed another system at India. We placed another -- we stood up Singapore. We just got our first order in Europe and in a key center in France. We got -- we just got approval recently in Australia. We're starting to launch in the Nordics. We are starting to launch in the UK. So we we feel like the international expansion is a big opportunity for us.\", \"And then, we think about the indication expansion sometime this summer in the neurovascular space. We look at that as a force multiplier for growth. So we would be excited about the number of leads we have because we have previously publicly said we have 150 or so leads that we were working on. I would say that continues to grow. We've got the neurovascular leads that continue to come in. As I mentioned in the call, we do approximately one to two VIP visits per week on neurovascular to get them up to speed on our technology. And I would anticipate that continuing to grow.\", 'As we think about the number of installations to close out 2019, I would anticipate us being close to 100 range, maybe a bit -- a little bit less than that in terms of future projections, but yeah, we closed out 2018 with 52 installations globally, but I think indication expansion, telerobotics and a greater international penetration will only help accelerate that.', 'Drew Ranieri -- Stifel -- Analyst', 'Thanks so much. And just you touched a little bit on this -- on international, but one thing that really caught our eye was the first European order. So can you just maybe go into a little bit more detail of how you see the European opportunity specifically for PCI, peripheral and neurovascular in days to come.', 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', \"Yeah, as I've mentioned previously, we haven't spent a lot of time in Europe, mostly because it's just a high cost burden on organizations to go into Europe because it's multiple different laws and regulations and how you get access into capital funding, but what we've seen is, we've seen an increased interest in robotics in Europe and funding sources are coming from foundational elements where -- or you have philanthropy donating the capital and then the institution acquires the capital, start to build out the robotic programs.\", \"And we have recently launched in -- or are launching in France right now, all right. We think that the interest level in Europe is continuing to grow for vascular robotics driven off of a lot of the work we're doing in automation, remote, as well as neurovascular. There's a significant interest in remote stroke treatment in Europe since they're a socialized medicine model, the disability cost of stroke management is a significant cost burden on their government. So they really see this as an increasing value proposition that's going to continue to grow.\", 'Drew Ranieri -- Stifel -- Analyst', 'Great, thanks for the color, Mark.', 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', 'Thanks, Drew.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen of Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.', 'Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst', 'Hi, Mark and David. How are you?', 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', 'Hey, Jeff.', 'Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst', 'Hey, I wanted to (inaudible), firstly, could you talk a little bit about the changes or differences, modifications for the neuro indication and how that progressed as far as the application to the FDA?', 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', \"Sure. Good question, Jeff. So what we did in 2018 is we looked at our current system CorPath GRX, and the FDA currently looks at our approval process of are we compatible with devices or not? As you know, Jeff, we don't make anything that goes in the body. So we use currently approved FDA -- FDA-approved devices that we insert into the body for treatment and access.\", \"So, we needed to do some testing on the neuro devices, which we did that, completed that, and we made only slight modifications. It was great experience for us because we didn't have to completely reoutfit a robot for neurovascular. We're able to do minor changes to software and minor changes to our disposable, which is called a cassette. And those two things alone, provided us a high confidence that we have compatibility with all of the market leading neurovascular devices from all the companies that like the Medtronics, the Strykers, the Penumbras of the world. So that's what we used to submit into the FDA back on February 14.\", 'Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst', 'Okay, got it. And you spoke a little bit about the US path to telerobotics and some of the movements at the technIQ software house and how does that relate to the RoR that you had before? And what specific files or applications will you have to get through or do you perceive getting through the FDA to get this added on as far as some of the software changes and movements?', 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', \"Yeah, great question. So automation, we really look at something that could speed procedures up considerably, particularly for the average operator that doesn't have the same skills as the expert. And as you know, with RoR or what we call Rotate on Retract, that was our first entree into automation, which showed a 53% reduction in wiring time for a physician. And with our submission back in late 2017 and approval subsequently after that in early 2018 for RoR. We established a -- I'll call it a pathway to regulatory approval for automation. We're essentially replicating that pathway with the additional four automated movements that we're submitting in to the FDA here soon, which we would anticipate being well received based upon what we learned in the early days of automation.\", \"So sometime this summer, we're going to have -- we view a kind of a library of algorithms that physician can choose -- could choose to provide them with some automation or smart procedural control that would allow them to complete procedures more efficiently and effectively and faster so that they could speed up their day as well as potentially even add more cases to their day. So we're really excited about that and believe that's going to be a continued driver of utilization for us as well.\", 'Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst', \"Okay, got it. What's the specific approval process as you submit each specific movement or software modification algorithms?\", 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', \"Yeah, it's a 510(k) submission and we we base it off of specs that we've already got defined within the FDA. And so it's -- should be a very smooth process for us as we're anticipating a well-received physician with the FDA on this.\", 'Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst', 'Okay, got it, and then lastly, could you talk a little more about HCA? Maybe give us a little color on the geography of the hospital or perhaps some color on the number of physicians thus far that have been involved in the process or conducted cases?', 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', 'Yeah. So we mentioned HCA and the the account that we were able to install our first robotic system in that big IDN, obviously, the biggest one in the United States. I think it represents close to 5% of the US healthcare. Very exciting hospital. It was down in Texas. And as you know, HCA is predominantly in the southeast, but also nationally, but it represents a cornerstone of what we can build on with that healthcare system. As a matter of fact, they had a call with their corporate office earlier today as we are kind of plotting out the next steps we make within that healthcare organization.', \"So moving in a really, really good path with a lot of these big integrated delivery networks that have multiple hospitals, and as they start to think about telerobotics, it could be a big benefit for them in a hub and spoke model when they've got hundreds of hospitals that they're trying to treat patients in and they don't have enough physicians to do it. So it can be a really compelling value proposition for these big IDNs that exist in the United States.\", 'Jeffrey Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst', 'Okay, super. Thanks for taking the questions.', 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', 'Thanks, Jeff.', 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.', 'Mark J. Toland -- President and CEO', 'Great. Well, thanks for everybody who joined the call. We appreciate your interest in Corindus and we look forward to maintaining a continual update with you on future calls. Have a good evening.', 'Operator', \"This concludes today's conference call.

Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at the same link as this webcast.\n",
      "\n",
      "4 During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]\n",
      "\n",
      "5 But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n",
      "\n",
      "6 Thanks, Martin. Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla history, but also the most successful. Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S. for 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "7 And in fact, when considering battery electric vehicles, Tesla achieved an 80% market share of U.S. sales in the last year. I think this point is perhaps not well appreciated. All other electric vehicles combined were 20% of sales in the U.S. in last year. So I think that's not so bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "8 We also delivered - also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined, which is tremendous achievement by the Tesla team. The - if you track Tesla vehicle production year-over-year, cumulative sales and deliveries year-over-year, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "9 We've basically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as many cars as we did in all prior years. So this is a very unusual thing to see for - especially for a large complex manufactured object, I think maybe the fastest that a complex manufactured object like a car has grown in history or at least I'm not aware of anything that is faster. Martin, are youâ€¦?\n",
      "\n",
      "10 I'm not sure. I think Model T was a little bit slower, but I'm not 100% sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "11 Okay. And we expect that exponential to continue. So with the deliveries this year being - even in the face of - if there's a global recession - even if there's a global recession, we're expecting deliveries this year to be about 50% higher than last year. And this - it could be a lot more than that. But even with tough economic times, to see 50% growth is pretty nutty.\n",
      "\n",
      "12 For Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability, the second quarter for the first time in the company history, and we increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt [in EMEA] [ph] with the total of $3.7 billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle our convertible bond that will mature in March.\n",
      "\n",
      "13 In addition, our operating margin remains strong at 5.7%. Operating margins in the fourth quarter are usually lower in the automotive industry, but this was not the case with Tesla.\n",
      "\n",
      "14 2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla. As I mentioned, we are expecting to increase sales by 50%. Perhaps could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. But that's crazy growth for the automotive industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "15 I want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations. So really, from my standpoint, when I think about what my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service in North America. That's number one. And I think we have very exciting [indiscernible] we're going to roll out with the [indiscernible]. We're going to get cars to China and Europe and make sure that we have good logistics for the whole delivery process, from factory gate to the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "16 That's obviously pretty far from California to get to Europe and China and make it to - get the car to customers. So we're working every aspect of that logistics chain, and I think we've - I think it's going to be good. I'd say at this point, I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1. Not by a lot, but I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "17 So let's see, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing out our total locations worldwide to 378. And we increased our Mobile Service fleet to 411 vehicles. Mobile Service fleet is something we can scale up very rapidly, because we don't need bricks and mortar, we can get more vehicles, hire people and deploy rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "18 It also actually results from higher customer satisfaction, because we can actually send one of our service vans to your work or home and fix the car without you having to bring it into the service center or do any paperwork or anything like that. It's really seamless and invisible. The customers love it.\n",
      "\n",
      "19 And we're also increasing the functionality of the Tesla App for service, so that instead of having to make an appointment - to call and make an appointment, you just open your Tesla App, say you want to make a service appointment, and it was the top 10 most frequently requested service items, and you can - with a couple of taps, you've made yourself an appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "20 And we're going to make it easier for the car to be picked up and dropped off as well. So if you want - if you prefer not coming to the service center at all, you can just request that the car be picked up and delivered. That's something that we'll be - so that's already - we're going to roll it out and have a big improvement to customer satisfaction. It rolled out two or three weeks ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "21 But the next thing we're going to add is, if a car detects something wrong, like a flat tire or a drive unit failure, that before the car has even come to a halt, there is a tow truck and a service loader on the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "22 The car has already notified Tesla emergency services, and a service loader, a tow truck, are on their way before your car has even come to a stop. I think this will be immense in improving customer happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "23 [Indiscernible] call it and you have to tap the center screen to cancel it. So you can cancel it if you want. We just have to - it's like automatically going to happen. You just press cancel.\n",
      "\n",
      "24 We're also improving parts distribution. So I think we made a strategic error in the past about not having service parts located at our service centers. We had them in parts distribution warehouses, which basically meant it was impossible to have a fast turnaround on servicing a car, because the car would come in, then the parts will be requested, they come to the service center, this would basically - even if they're very simple, repair could take days.\n",
      "\n",
      "25 So we're going to be able to stock in all common parts at the service centers, so that it's possible to - - get your car serviced in 20 minutes or 15 minutes, even if it's a simple matter. I mean, it should be like eight minutes or whatever, eight minutes. It should be like lightning fast. But in order to - we have to have the parts located at our service centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "26 Also, it's going to make sense for our service centers to do basic body work or essentially to replace a front or rear fascia, it makes sense to just prestock the front and rear fascia in the common colors. So unless you have an unusual color, we can literally replace your fascia in 15, 20 minutes, and this is not like, weeks at a body shop stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "27 In terms of the new products, with Model Y, we've completed ensuring of ensign of Model Y, and the parts are - [indiscernible] for production Model Y. Three quarters of the Model Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3. And the risk is also quite low.\n",
      "\n",
      "28 This is in contrast to Model S versus Model X where the theory was - I think Model X, we just - it's sort of Model X to be like the sort of the FabergÃ© egg of cars. It's an incredible vehicle and probably one - probably nothing like it will ever be made again, and maybe it shouldn't. But it is a work of art. It's a special work of art.\n",
      "\n",
      "29 But the commonality with the Model S is limited. It was only about maybe 30% in common with the Model S, whereas Model Y is, I think, 76% was what it got in common with the Model 3. And we're most likely going to put Model Y production right next to - in fact, it's part of our main Gigafactory in Nevada.\n",
      "\n",
      "30 So it will just be right there. Batteries and powertrains will come out and go straight into the vehicle. So that also reduces our risk of execution and reduces the cost of having to transfer parts from California to Nevada. It's not a for sure thing, but it's quite likely, and it's our default plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "31 I would expect Model Y will probably be - the [indiscernible] Model Y will be maybe 50% higher than Model 3, could be even double. The - as I understand it, the midsized SUV segment is the - worldwide is the most popular type of vehicle. So we'll probably see a higher volume of Y than 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "32 And earlier this month, we saw the construction of our Gigafactory in Shanghai, and by the end of this year, we expect to be producing Model 3s using a complete vehicle production line. That's body paint, final assembly, general assembly and module production.\n",
      "\n",
      "33 So it basically would be - this will be extremely fast. I get like daily updates of progress of the Shanghai Gigafactory, and those factories are going to go up like lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "34 So we do feel quite confident at this point, at least for the factories that are in our control, that we can achieve volume production in Shanghai by the end of the year. And that should allow us to get to the 10,000 vehicles a week rate or very close to it by the end of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "35 And yes, I think that's it.\n",
      "\n",
      "36 Okay, great. So we're going to take the first questions from our retail investors who have been submitting their questions on say.com. So the question that has been submitted has been about service, which I think you already spoke at length about. So let's go to the second question.\n",
      "\n",
      "37 The second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now across the product line? Is 500,000 to 700,000 units at 42,000 ASP still a realistic annual target for Model 3, even considering Model Y and its impact on demand? And do you continue to see S and X demand of 100,000 annually?\n",
      "\n",
      "38 I mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide is something - in a strong economy, it's something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year. That's my best guess for demand of Model 3 in a strong economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "39 If the economy goes into a recession, then I think that could be something under 40% less. But I think even in a recession, worldwide demand is still something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "40 For S and X, we did eliminate the 75 [indiscernible] of S and X and product model differentiation relative to 3 and then Y that's coming out. I think we could see a slight decline in total vehicles, but I think the net cash flow from S and X is likely to be very similar. So probably no major change in net cash flow for S and X.\n",
      "\n",
      "41 Okay. The next question from Alex is, can you please share an update on full self-driving and Tesla Network development? When will customers start to see full self-driving features? What's the best case time line for a Tesla Network to go live?\n",
      "\n",
      "42 Sure. We have - we already have full self-driving capability on highway. So from highway on ramp to highway exit, including passing cars and going from one highway interchange to another, full self-driving capability is there.\n",
      "\n",
      "43 In a few weeks, we'll be pushing update that will allow the option of removing stock confirmed in markets where regulators approve it, which we believe that will be the case in the U.S., for example. And over time, we think probably all regulators will approve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "44 But we kept talking from there just to make sure that we took care of like - of any strange corner cases. And it's really quite sublime if you have stock confirm of and like the car goes from highway on ramp, passes slower cars, change - takes an interchange and then takes the exit and then comes to a stop after the exit. So it's really quite profound to have that experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "45 Then the next part of full self-driving will really be to - is traffic lights. It's hard. So stop streets are pretty easy because you can essentially geocode those and is recognized at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "46 Traffic lights and intersections will be the next really tricky one. And then navigating complex parking lots and like - sort of like if you're underground in a mall parking lot with a lot of traffic and pedestrians and it's on multiple levels, that kind of thing is what gets tricky.\n",
      "\n",
      "47 With the release of enhanced or advanced Summon, you'll see the first indications of the car being able to navigate complex parking lots, and that's also coming up fairly soon, probably next month. And in development mode, the car does all the things that I just mentioned in development mode. It recognizes traffic lights and stop signs and basically has all the functionality in development mode. It's really just a question of getting your reliability of recognizing traffic lights to several names.\n",
      "\n",
      "48 So I guess like, I don't know, 98% good right now, but we need it to be like 99.999%, really extremely reliable. So - and the capability will be there for - when will we think it's safe for full self-driving? It's probably towards the end of this year, and then it's up to regulators to decide when they want to approve that.\n",
      "\n",
      "49 Okay. Let's go to the next question, which is, if and when will Tesla switch Model S and X to 2170 battery cells? What percent range improvement do you expect?\n",
      "\n",
      "50 We have no plans to switch S and X to 2170 and can't comment on huge product developments.\n",
      "\n",
      "51 Okay. So maybe we'll take the last question from retail investors, which was, where will Tesla Semi and Model Y be produced? Can you share a time line on expected production ramp of these products?\n",
      "\n",
      "52 As I mentioned earlier, the Model Y, we think, most likely will be produced at Gigafactory, but that's - unless we encounter some obstacle - that's the default plan that we're proceeding towards. And it's fast, low risk and also low CapEx. In terms of the - I mean, probably there's like initial production of Model Y, very low volume, probably next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "53 But then it always takes time to ramp up any production system, and that's difficult to predict the shape of that S-curve. So we feel confident in saying there will be production volume of Model Y by the end of next year, but in between beginning of next year with low volume, it always starts with very low growth exponentially - from beginning of last year to end of next year, it's difficult to break that ramp. So that's our expectation for Y. For Semi, we're - I don't know if you want to comment on that, Jerome.\n",
      "\n",
      "54 I want to start next year as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "55 Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "56 But the first units will be - this is Jerome. Well, first units will be for our own usage. So depends how many trucks we'll use for our own usage to move the parts and the vehicle in different location, and then we'll start delivering to outside customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "57 Yes, that's good. And then the Tesla pickup truck, we might be ready to unveil that this summer. It will be something quite unique, unlike anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "58 Okay. Fantastic. So operator, we can start taking questions from participants on the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "59 Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\n",
      "\n",
      "60 Thanks for taking my question. I think - the amount that you've spent on lands for Gigafactory Shanghai in the classification operating cash flows, is there any guidance you can provide us in terms of how to think about CapEx for this facility going forward? And can you discuss the source of funds for the project?\n",
      "\n",
      "61 I think you've spoken in the past about the potential to raise that locally in China. Is that still your thinking? And what kind of terms might you be able to raise that capital?\n",
      "\n",
      "62 Yes, Deepak here. You're right. The purchase of the land is a 50-year lease with the government of China. So it's not CapEx, but it's operating lease, that shows up as cash flow from operations. However, the CapEx that we will invest is our equipment, and we fully own it. So that will show up as capital expenditures.\n",
      "\n",
      "63 The plan, as we have indicated in the letter, is still to get funding for majority of that capital spending from local China banks. And we expect pretty attractive rates based on the dialogue we've had. And there's a lot of interest. And we hope to finalize that and then share the details at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "64 Yes. I mean, as a ballpark figure, probably it's something about - something in the order of $0.5 billion in CapEx to get to the 3,000 vehicle rates in Shanghai, ballpark figure. And as Deepak was saying, [indiscernible] very competitive debt financing in China, really extremely compelling interest rates, and we do not expect that to be a capital drain on the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "65 Yes. These are the biggest banks in the world, and for them, $500 million is not a large amount of money on the scheme of things.\n",
      "\n",
      "66 Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "67 Sorry perhaps - if you're in the automotive industry youâ€™ll understand how significant this is but maybe it's not as obvious to everyone is Tesla has the first wholly owned manufacturing facility in China for any - of any automotive company. So this is profound, and we're very appreciative of the Chinese government allowing us to do this. I think it is symbolic of [indiscernible] open the market. And if I - and you know, it [indiscernible], so like a note of appreciation for the Chinese government in allowing us to do that. It's a very significant thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "68 Question I have is related to Waymo and the autonomous driving opportunity. Morgan Stanley recently valued Waymo at $175 billion. And my question is, what do they have that you don't have? And separately - so what do they have that you don't have?\n",
      "\n",
      "69 And then separately, how important is the timing in the Tesla story longer term? Is this nice to have? Is it really about EVs and renewable energy? Or is the autonomy kind of one of the foundational parts of the story longer term?\n",
      "\n",
      "70 [Indiscernible] goodness of Tesla, yes, so like the why of Tesla, the relevance, what's the point of Tesla, comes down to two things: acceleration of sustainable energy and autonomy. The acceleration of sustainable energy is absolutely fundamental because this is the next potential risk for humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "71 So actually, that is, by far and away, the most important thing. But also, very important is autonomy. This has the potential to save millions of lives, tens of millions of serious public injuries and give people their time back, so that they don't have to drive, they can - if you're on the road, you can spend time doing things that you enjoy instead of being in terrible traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "72 So it's extremely important. We feel confident about our technical strategy, and I think we have an advantage that no one else has, which is, that we have, at this point, somewhere in the order of 300,000 vehicles on the road, with a 360-degree camera sensor suite, radar, ultrasonics, always connected uploads, especially video clips with the customer [submission] [ph] when there is intervention. So effectively, we have a massive, massive training fleet.\n",
      "\n",
      "73 Our - the amount of training that we have - if you add everyone else up combined, they're probably 5%, I'm being generous, of the miles that Tesla has. And this difference is increasing. A year from now, we'll probably go - certainly from 18 months from now, we'll probably have 1 million vehicles on the road with - and every time the customers drive the car, they're training the systems to be better. I'm just not sure how anyone competes with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "74 Thank you. Our next question...\n",
      "\n",
      "75 Sorry, do you have a follow-up question? Okay, no follow-up question. Okay. Let's go to the next participant.\n",
      "\n",
      "76 Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.\n",
      "\n",
      "77 Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit about the geographic dispersion for the guidance for 2019, where you're expecting the Model 3s to sell through as well as the other models?\n",
      "\n",
      "78 Well, I think we did, actually. Yes, it's clear in our letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "79 We indicated in Q1, we will start delivering Model 3s in Europe and China. And we also shared a chart showing the potential market size for midsized premium sedans in North America, Europe and Asia, suggesting those markets could be even bigger. So I think that gives a good sense of where we'll be. And we'll launch the right-hand drive version at some point to go to the other markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "80 Yes. Maybe in the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "81 Okay. And then just in terms of the cost reduction road map and rework post-factory, can you talk a little bit about your expectation for reducing that in the next couple of quarters and what the order of magnitude is on that in your model internally?\n",
      "\n",
      "82 Jerome, do you want to answer that?\n",
      "\n",
      "83 This is Jerome. Well, our manufacturing is improving quarter-over-quarter. Actually, week-over-week, we take fewer hours, both here in Fremont or at the Gigafactory, to assemble the Model 3 and S and X as well. And then we track the quality very closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "84 We review that carefully with the engineers and the supply chain and the manufacturing team. And the quality in the field and the number of incidents is also improving week-over-week, every week. So there are fewer and fewer need for cars to be in service, yes. So we'll keep going. There's no end in sight. And we'll try to make sure that the car never breaks down.\n",
      "\n",
      "85 Yes, I think there's like some confusion about rectification. Like I said - like - for us to drive the Model 3s that come off the line, all that happens is like some slight adjustment of drawer gaps and panel gaps and that kind of thing, and that's all that's done. There's nothing more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "86 Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.\n",
      "\n",
      "87 Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the comments around you said about 700,000 to 800,000, you think, is the normal demand. I mean, any color on what price you're expecting that to be? Because I think there's a lot of chatter that demand is already weak in - of the midrange, at least, already in January. I don't know if that's true as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "88 Yes. I mean, - there are multiple factors at play here. First of all, there's a lot of seasonality to automotive purchases. Most people do not buy a new car in the middle of a blizzard. So January and February tends to be seasonally low and then picks up significantly around the early to mid-March time frame. In the U.S., we obviously have a pull forward of demand from the tax credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "89 And yes, there's - so there's all those factors. But I feel very confident about Model 3 demand. The customer happiness level with the car is incredible and I think probably the highest of any car in the world right now, I think. And so you can tell like, basically, nobody wants to sell their car. \n",
      "\n",
      "90 But the target price point is, I think, in the past, you mentioned mid-$40,000. Is that where we're thinking or a long-term range?\n",
      "\n",
      "91 Yes, this is really just a guess. So it's not like I got some huge crystal ball or something. But at volume, I would expect, this is totally a guess, I want to be clear, probably an average of $42,000, probably at that volume level. I'm not certain on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "92 And just as a follow-up. You commented that you expect China to be online by the end of the year, but there's a lot of articles that the battery supplier - you're looking at different battery suppliers. But, I mean, do you have a battery supplier? Because it seems kind of close to when production is supposed to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "93 Well, there's really three things: the cell, the module and the pack. We will be making the module and the pack. So it's really just a question of cell supply. And we can essentially use any [high density] [ph] 2170 chemistry. And we expect to be a combination of cells produced at our Gigafactory in Nevada and cells produced in Japan and cells produced locally in China. And we feel confident to have a sufficient supply to hit the 3,000 units.\n",
      "\n",
      "94 Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "95 First, I wanted to ask you about the short-range Model 3. What are your latest thoughts in terms of timing of introduction? I think at some point, you had in mind to do it in the - maybe the first half of this year. And just to clarify, when you're sort of talking about the outlook for 2019, the number of deliveries up 50% and then the margin target for Model 3 to get to 25%, does that assume that you're introducing a lower range, the short-range Model 3 at some point during the year?\n",
      "\n",
      "96 Well, you could call it the standard range, but it's maybe short by Tesla's standards, but it's long range by other manufacturers' standards. So - but yes, we expect to introduce the standard range Model 3 sometime - probably the middle of this year is a rough, rough guess. And we're working hard to improve our costs of production, our overhead costs, our fixed costs, just costs in general. I think this past year, while extremely difficult, has driven us to a high level of financial discipline. I think we're way smarter about how we spend money, and we're getting better with each passing week. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "97 And so to be clear, the - you expect to reach at some point this year - or you're targeting at some point this year 25% gross margins on Model 3, and that's despite introducing the lower-end - or just the standard range Model 3. Is that correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "98 Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "99 Okay. And, I guess, my follow-up would be on the demand side. So you're talking about 50% increase this year. You said a few times that it could be higher than this. I think you just mentioned in the previous question 350,000 to 500,000, if I understood well. So what is sort of like what drives the cautious outlook that's in your letter? Because it feels like it's the - it's just basically four times the fourth quarter run rate, which would imply sort of 50% for the full year but not really a lot of growth versus what you just accomplished. So, I guess, how do we think about the total demand for 2019, especially if you introduced this - the cheaper version?\n",
      "\n",
      "100 Well, we need to bring the Shanghai factory online. I think that's the biggest driver for getting to 500K plus a year. Our car is just very expensive going into China. We've got import duties. We've got transport costs. We've got higher-cost labor here. And we've never been eligible for any of the EV tax credits. A lot of people sort of dependent on incentives. In fact, we are [indiscernible] EVs, we have the least access to incentives. It's pretty crazy because there's so many companies that - countries that have put price caps on the EV incentive, which affects Tesla. And in China, which is the biggest market for EVs, we've never had any subsidies or tax incentives for vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "101 So it's - it is eligible for that. But it sounds like that's going to be reducing in China in the coming years. But, really, bottom line is, we need the Shanghai factory to achieve that 10k rate and other cars be affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "102 The demand for - the demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is affordability. It's just like people literally don't have the money to buy the car. It's got nothing to do with desire. They just don't have enough money in their bank account. If the car can be made more affordable, the demand is extraordinary.\n",
      "\n",
      "103 Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.\n",
      "\n",
      "104 So, Deepak, I was wondering, so as you get to 2019, we're all concerned about the potential recession, and I was wondering how you think about it and what you would tell us about what we should expect - how we should expect Tesla to react to recession in 2019. How do you manage your volume land? How do you manage your pricing? How do you present cash? How do you manage your CapEx if things turn south in 2019? And then I have a follow-up on gross margin for Jerome.\n",
      "\n",
      "105 Yes, it's a very broad question, which is not really just for me to answer. But I think at the highest level, the way we are trying to be prepared for any kind of contingency here is to just continue focusing on cost. And the theme of our conversations here is, how do we reduce cost all the time? And how do we run our business with a very high level of financial discipline? And Elon alluded to that and so did Jerome - Jerome, I think. That - if we do that, we believe that even in some of the scenarios of lower volumes and pricing - tight pricing, we do have a good chance and a good shot of being profitable and generate free cash flow. So that's the best way to manage the business, be frugal.\n",
      "\n",
      "106 Yes, I don't want to be a broken record about this, it's costs, costs, costs, because reducing our costs - by the way, while making improvements to Model 3, I want to emphasize, the product is getting better by slight degrees despite lower costs in hundreds of small ways. But you actually wouldn't notice explicitly, but they would appreciate subconsciously. And getting those costs down, variable costs and fixed costs, is what allows us to lower the price and be financially sustainable and achieve our mission of environmental sustainability. So we have to be absolute clear about this. There's no question.\n",
      "\n",
      "107 The other aspect of this, Elon, which we've been doing extremely well, is capital efficiency. We have dramatically cut back on capital expense, and we are spending it in a very efficient manner. We talked about it in the letter on Model 3 and Gigafactory Shanghai. We talked about it for Model Y. There are just so many learnings that we are incorporating, and we just want to beat what we did with Model 3 and the kind of spending we had for the returns we got.\n",
      "\n",
      "108 Absolutely. I mean, we're confident that our CapEx per unit of production for Shanghai factory and for Model Y will be less than half of what we did for Model 3. Internally, we think it might be a quarter but that's probably too good to believe, but it's definitely less than half.\n",
      "\n",
      "109 Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "\n",
      "110 First thing I want to just understand is on what you're seeing from European orders and China orders so far. There are some numbers that get thrown around, but you guys are obviously taking a look at it. How is that order profile shaping up relative to what you saw in the U.S. with the launch of the 3?\n",
      "\n",
      "111 I think it seems good. I mean, our share actually with Europe and China is, how do we get the cars made and on a boat as such that it reaches customers before end of quarter and we don't have a massive number of cars on the water. That's our biggest challenge. It's not demand. It's how do we get the cars there fast enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "112 So like orders above, I think I've seen like 20,000 order levels for Europe and single-digit thousands for China is better than that, Elon?\n",
      "\n",
      "113 Yes, absolutely. The - I mean, we're not even really trying, I should point out. I guess it's - we - our factory is like, right now, only making cars for China and Europe. That's all it's doing for - with respect to Model 3. And our whole focus is, okay, how do we get those cars made, get them on a ship as fast as possible, get the ship as fast as possible to Zeebrugge in Belgium then get them over to Drammen in Norway and get those cars to customers as fast as possible. We get them to China as fast as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "114 In China, we were also - yes, we don't what's going to happen with the trade negotiations. So that's very important to get those cars especially to China as soon as possible. We hope the trade negotiations go well, but it's not clear. But we need to get them there while there's sort of a de facto - sort of a truce on the tariff war. And the demand gen is really not one of the things we're thinking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "115 Okay. Then just lastly on this demand thread, customer deposit came in again over $100 million. Is it possible to give us an update? I know you don't think it's really a relevant number but I do want to know. Explain why on the reservation count, where you were 450,000, you started delivering. And I ask this because I think we're just all trying to understand how much incremental demand you think there is based on what you see at that lower price point if, say, there's over half of those people that are still waiting for that 75k base model to come out. That would be interesting, and I think that's what you're seeing but I just want to confirm that.\n",
      "\n",
      "116 So Deepak, do you want to...\n",
      "\n",
      "117 Yes, I mean, I think reservations are not relevant for us. We are really focused on orders. Now we do have a large reservations backlog still, which tells us that a lot of customers are still waiting for those cars, but I don't think it's appropriate to share the reservations number.\n",
      "\n",
      "118 Reservations are just like preorders. It's like here - like some video game come out and there's like a preorder number, then that's like - stops being important once you start shipping the game or product. So yes, as I said earlier, I think - my guess is demand is somewhere on the order - in a strong economy is on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year for Model 3 and even in a recession is probably on the order of 0.5 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "119 Our next question comes from Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "120 So my question is around Europe. Obviously, with deliveries coming onboard in the first quarter, maybe what surprised you in terms of - your demand looks strong, but in terms of what you're seeing at the region, is it stronger than you expected in certain countries? What do you think is driving that? And maybe you can just talk about the opportunities and challenges in Europe especially from a delivery logistics perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "121 Well, like I said, we're thinking about demand almost zero right now. It's really getting the product there in time and not having a ton of cars on the water and in a quarter and then for China getting cars there before there's a potential rise in tariffs. That's really - put really at front of mind that cost reduction and then improving service in North America, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "122 And just maybe a quick follow-up on - can you just talk about - when we look at the Gigafactory build-out in China and obviously how important that is, can you maybe just fast forward, let's say, 18, 24 months? I mean, how do you envision that as just a competitive advantage versus maybe some other automakers that will be trying to go in your tracks?\n",
      "\n",
      "123 I think it will be quite a significant advantage, a really good - it's quite fundamental to the future of Tesla, and I expect to make several trips to China this year. And I'm working very closely with the team building the factory. I literally get daily updates. So it's a super big deal and we're only just talking about Phase 1 here. Phase 1 is about 10% of what we think the Gigafactory will ultimately be. So it's a major, major, major deal. And we're getting a lot of support from the Shanghai government, which we're very appreciative of, and the national government.\n",
      "\n",
      "124 Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\n",
      "\n",
      "125 You've talked repeatedly about the need to drive down costs, which, in turn, drives the elasticity of demand for cars. And I'm wondering if you can talk about how much of a price differential between the $50,000 Model 3 and the $35,000 Model 3 is structural, meaning that powertrain costs for EVs are just structurally higher than they are for internal combustion engine cars. And where do you think that difference is today and when that is no longer a factor? So is - or maybe said another way, is the bigger driver in getting to lower costs and lower - and more affordability on the Model 3, is it really around the powertrain and getting that at parity? Or is it everything else about Tesla not being as efficient as other manufacturers that is causing the higher price right now? And have I follow-up, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "126 It's both, it's both, the vehicle and both the powertrain. So I split my time half and half between the Gigafactory and here, and there is opportunities in both, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "127 But I think the bigger point is that, yes, there is cost reduction opportunities out, but the bigger point is it's not that our cost is higher than a gas-powered or an internal combustion engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "128 I think what Toni meant is with the battery pack, as in battery pack as well as the powertrain together, are more expensive than an engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "129 That's true.\n",
      "\n",
      "130 And how big do you think that delta is today? And when it's - do you think of it as being kind of $10,000, $11,000 for that pack plus powertrain for an electric vehicle and maybe $5,000 or $6,000 for an internal combustion engine car? And is that sort of the order of magnitude? And where do you see those getting much more aligned just sort of given the lives of where you think cell and pack costs are going?\n",
      "\n",
      "131 Well, the biggest part to bear in mind is because of electricity, it's quite a bit less than the cost of gasoline, especially in Europe or in California or China, basically almost everywhere except, say, the middle of the United States, where the cost of gasoline is very expensive and electricity is far cheaper. The - so that factors in to the cost of ownership pretty significantly. It's on - sort of going on the order of $50 to $100 a month depending upon how much somebody drives. So that's a very important thing to consider for an electric car versus a gasoline car. The - that said, in terms of initial cost of acquisition, I think it's probably - this is just off the top of my head, not a calculated number, probably on the order of 7k but trending towards 4k or 5k. It's off the top of my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "132 Okay. And as you think about 2019, you talked about sort of scenarios for demand and how you plan to roll out the intermediate range and then ultimately the standard range. What is - if you do have to make a trade-off on volume or profitability during the course of the year, meaning to get the volume you need or you think you can deliver, you have to go to lower margins or vice versa, where's the trade-off? Is - are units produced most important to you? Or is delivering the 25% gross margin more important? So if you have a chance to deliver 450,000 or 500,000 cars but they'll be more standard editions and gross margins will end the year at 20%, is that - are you willing to make that trade-off?\n",
      "\n",
      "133 My guess is it ends up being sort of about the 6.5 [does together] where if there's a given amount of free cash flow, you sort of decide - you decide to achieve that with a smaller production or smaller volume of cars or at a higher margin or large volume cars at a smaller margin. I think we're already towards the second. We're going to make more cars at a lower margin, but I think it's more or less a flat rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "134 Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.\n",
      "\n",
      "135 Can you just update us on where battery costs are now and where you anticipate they'll be by year-end? I'm just trying to gauge how much of a factor this is to lowering costs and sustaining profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "136 That's a highly proprietary number. We cannot give it out, but I'd like to tell you but no. We do think we have the best costs in the world. We're - to the best of our knowledge, our costs are lower than anyone else right now and they're improving.\n",
      "\n",
      "137 And maybe talk about your expectations with the Panasonic-Toyota JV and how it might impact you. Was this something that you were made aware of?\n",
      "\n",
      "138 I spoke directly with Tsuga-san about this, the Head of Panasonic, and he assured me this will have no impact on Tesla.\n",
      "\n",
      "139 Our next question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.\n",
      "\n",
      "140 Do you plan to offer a U.S. lease product for Model 3 in the U.S.? When can we expect it? And can you talk about what percentage of S and X have historically been leased in the U.S.?\n",
      "\n",
      "141 Well, we've been reluctant to introduce the leasing on Model 3 because of how - of its effect on GAAP financials. So it is worth noting that demand to date is with zero leasing. So obviously, leasing is a way to improve demand but it has - it makes our financials looks worse. So we're - we don't want to introduce that right away. I mean, we'll introduce it sometime later this year probably. What - I'm not sure the percentage of lease is for S and X right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "142 It's around 20%, low 20s, and it stayed stable at that level for many, many quarters, which is - it seems like the natural demand because we don't do [some invention or] artificially bump up.\n",
      "\n",
      "143 Yes, exactly. Our leases are legit. The - it usually expects a small business. Tax write-off is important for the - for leasing. So...\n",
      "\n",
      "144 Okay. And then I have just, like, two quick housekeeping questions. One, is there a restructuring charge that you expect in the first quarter? How much is it? And is it included in your expectation of a small profit?\n",
      "\n",
      "145 Yes, it is included in that. It's difficult to say exactly what that is. At this point, it's, let's say, roughly around $40 million, but that number can vary slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "146 Okay. And then just the last one is...\n",
      "\n",
      "147 Sorry, go ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "148 Yes, the last one is, this change in your service parts structure to make things more distributed rather than in the parts warehouse is, would that be like a meaningful working capital drag? What's the cash impact of that?\n",
      "\n",
      "149 No, it's actually - we've just been very silly about where we store our parts. So it's actually going to be no change in sort of working capital or not something you would even notice in the financials. It's just being smarter about sending parts directly to service centers, in fact either directly from our factory here or from our suppliers and just ship and direct to the service center. Right now, actually, our costs will improve, I think, actually quite a lot, persistent, actually quite - they're kind of persistent. It's quite boneheaded, actually speaking self-referentially. So just being - so stopping doing the foolish things will massively improve our service costs, will massively improve customer happiness around the world, and it's just fundamentally better all around. I mean, there are some pretty - we've been just like super dumb in some of the things we've done, where - like [I went] to China last year as I always asked, \"Okay, what are we doing wrong? What can we fix?\" And then like our China team is great always. They're like, \"Well, do you think we could have spare parts that are made in China just sent directly to China service centers? Because currently, there's a bunch of parts that are made in China then sent to a warehouse in New Jersey and then sent back to China.\" Literally, what was happening? It's super [dumb stuff]. So it's going to get way better. And yes, it's very queer.\n",
      "\n",
      "150 Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.\n",
      "\n",
      "151 I have one question and it's got four parts to it. Happy new year, Elon. So the first part is - so our Street numbers, like consensus, we've got everything wrong for six years or seven years since you went public, and there are about $6 in earnings. Talk to us about that if you can. Number two, Elon, could you talk to us about - can you talk about - I hear you cut some workforce at SpaceX and there at Tesla. I feel that you have a worry about global economy. Can you talk to us about how you feel about that with your guidance in order - in the same order? And then can we talk about, maybe sort of third thing, for JV? No one's ever going to talk about stationary storage, but we had a whole page on that with pretty good speech, and what should we be focusing on that? And what can that add to the bottom line on top of that $6 this next year?\n",
      "\n",
      "152 I mean, we can't really, Ben, talk about consensus and what that means. I think the - maybe the better approach is we are providing certain guidance here and you and the other analysts need to reflect that in your modeling. And that's the best indication from the company of our projections. In all fairness, that's the best way I can think of answering your question here.\n",
      "\n",
      "153 Yes. J.B., is there anything...\n",
      "\n",
      "154 I mean, I think the letter outlines the predicted growth in the battery storage business, the stationary storage business pretty clearly, and that should be included in the projections as well. So I mean, we're excited about it but I can't say much more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "155 I mean, our internal projections for stationary storage are closer to 3 gigawatt hours. But some of it is kind of lumpy and may not be completed this year. We would have done more in stationary storage last year except we were so strong for vehicle production. So we had to convert a bunch of stationary storage lines, battery lines, to vehicle battery lines. Otherwise, we would have done quite a bit more in stationary storage. I expect that to grow, I mean, probably twice as fast as automotive for short - a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "156 We continue to set production records basically every month. So that's growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "157 And the profitability of the storage business and the gross margin continue to improve as we keep ramping up production and scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "158 It's going to be a gigantic business down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "159 And the last question was about economy, global economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "160 Sure. I mean, I do think that the economy moves in cycles and there's fairly a significant risk of a recession over the next 12 to 18 months, but I'm confident that Tesla will remain at least slightly profitable even with - even if there is a significant recession. And then when - and be all the stronger for it when there's recession. And the - we have to be relentless about cost in order to make affordable cars and not go back up. That's what our headcount reduction is about, yes, yes. I think we have to - it's - we have to be super hardcore about it. It's the only way to make affordable cars. The - on the SpaceX side, the cost reduction was for a different reason unrelated to - SpaceX has really - SpaceX has two absolutely insane projects that would normally bankrupt a company, Starship and Starlink, and so SpaceX has to be incredibly spartan with expenditures until those programs reach fruition.\n",
      "\n",
      "161 Okay, Great. I think that's all we have time for today. Thank you very much for your questions, and Elon would like to have some closing remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "162 Yes. So let's see. The - so Deepak is - well, I'd like you to make the announcement, but Deepak is going to be retiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "163 Again.\n",
      "\n",
      "164 Yes, from Tesla.\n",
      "\n",
      "165 Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "166 Deepak, I think it's now been - you first started with Tesla about 11 years ago, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "167 When - close to that, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "168 Yes, almost 11 years. Thank you for your tremendous contribution to Tesla. And he's announcing retirement but the retirement will not be immediate, but Deepak will continue to be at Tesla for a few more months and will continue to serve as a senior adviser to Tesla for probably years to come hopefully. And we thought long and hard about who the right person is to take over from Deepak, and that's Zach. And Zach has been with Tesla now for nine years...\n",
      "\n",
      "169 Nine years.\n",
      "\n",
      "170 Yes. So Zach [ph] you had management and technology at Wharton undergrad and then worked at Tesla and then spent a couple of years at Harvard Business School, which I actually don't think was necessary, by the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "171 You told me that when I came back.\n",
      "\n",
      "172 Yes, exactly. So Zach's incredibly talented, has made a huge contribution to Tesla over the years, and obviously a very well-known [quantity] to the whole team and has the respect of the whole team. And Zach, I don't know if you'd like to say a few words?\n",
      "\n",
      "173 Yes, I will.\n",
      "\n",
      "174 Okay. Or do you want, Deepak, to save you?\n",
      "\n",
      "175 Deepak?\n",
      "\n",
      "176 Sure, okay. Thank you, yes. Well, first of all, Elon, thank you very much for the opportunity for me to be here and be here again a second time. I've learned a lot from you and I've been always inspired by you, and I've been also very inspired by the team at Tesla who are incredibly brilliant, very passionate and just amazingly perseverant, the best team I could imagine. So thank you everybody for that. There is no good time to make this change. We felt strongly this was a good time. It's a new chapter, a new year. Tesla has had two great quarters of profitability, cash flow, so now a really solid foundation. And I feel really good about Zach taking over as the CFO. He's proven himself with his many years of experience and many tough challenges that he's worked on and really excited to have Zach take on this role, and I'll be here to support him and make sure we are all successful as a company.\n",
      "\n",
      "177 Yes, well, thank you, Deepak. Thank you, Elon. So my name is Zach Kirkhorn. Just a brief background on myself. So I joined Tesla just under nine years ago when it's a super small company with a lot of potential ahead of us and I was attracted to the mission and the vision of the company. Throughout that time, I've been deep in the operations of every major program of the company, from the Roadster to Model S and X, Model 3, scaling our Energy business and more things to come, which we've talked about on the call. I feel we're starting 2019 with a very strong financial foundation. We have enough cash to continue launching new programs and developing new technologies, and we're able to service upcoming debt obligations with our forecasted cash flows. My focus alongside the talented and amazingly passionate team at Tesla is to ensure we continue the terrific momentum on cost management and operational efficiency, which will enable us more - enable more access to our products around the world, which is key to achieving the mission of the company. On a personal note, Deepak, a huge thank you to you for your leadership, mentorship and support and very much looking forward to discussing our progress on future earnings calls.\n",

      "so i would say that there's a couple of variables in terms of the deployment of capital as a general matter. first, we obviously look at opportunities to deploy capital in accretive opportunities around growth initiatives, and so we'll continue to do that. and that is, in effect, redeploying capital from businesses that show less promise in terms of their overall return to those opportunities, both existing and new growth businesses, that show higher promise. secondly, and i don't have to tell you, that there are limitations obviously to what we can do in terms of share buyback by virtue of ccar, and we will continue to be as prudently aggressive as we can be in terms of the return of capital within the confines of ccar. and obviously, we have yet to receive the scenario planning for this year, but that will factor in as best we can. and so i think that's the way to think about the deployment of capital, generally speaking. one, being an internal reallocation based on growth. but second, and in the growth sense, we want to invest in areas which will carry accretive returns for our shareholders and that can grow. and so our ambition and our mo will be just around that.\n",

      "and candidly, from a competitive point of view, the operational deposits are quite attractive to us even if we pay rates well above that, which are being paid by other banks just in the context of substitution for wholesale funding. when you look at the technology that we're building, i would say that there's a certain element of it which is synergistic with other technology builds that we have been undertaking, including marcus and including what we've been building and strengthening the legal equity of gs bank us. so for example, the development of the payments hub, which is obviously central not just to what we do in the context of marcus, but equally what we would do in terms of corporate cash management. this business has developed over the last 5 or 10 years in terms of the ability to make use of many, many vendors to build this in the cloud, to integrate those vendors in a way that would have required organic build inside the organization, in a way that's not necessary now. i think as we build this and as we grow this, we're going to be selective. and we won't be all things to all people out of the box. we will select certain currencies among the major currencies where we will play. there are interesting vendor solutions that can take you to secondary and tertiary markets, where you don't necessarily need to build correspondent banking relationships on as proliferated a basis as you had 2 years ago. and so we intend to do that, that way. and so i think the technology is at hand. it's the right time to be doing this, and i think we can execute this. i'd also point out, just as an aside, that the first customer of this platform, in fact, will be goldman sachs such that we can reduce the cost of our own operational deposits outside of the bank, and i think in the process, de-risk the firm from that perspective.\n",

      "[technical difficulty] example of that is in any lending business, when you are in a growth mode, you continue to have reserve build right to the point at which you are at a comfortable, steady state. and from there, you start to see the margin increase. and so i think that each of these businesses, whether it's corporate cash management or marcus, are all in their early stages. they haven't yet hit their stride, notwithstanding our expectation that they'll hit the targets we set for them in 2020. those targets were, by no means, a limit of where we think we can take the firm in terms of the overall growth trajectory generally. i would also say that the commentary on efficiency and higher marginal margin should not be limited exclusively to kind of the growth initiatives themselves. so look at ficc, for example. ficc over time, and david was talking about this, there's an element of platform electronification as a means of which you can drive higher volumes in a narrowing a bid-offer spread. and i think even there, as we progress the initiative to build out those platforms, we'll realize greater margin. again, that's an incumbent business. so the commentary is not limited to those on the growth side.\n",

      "so as we talked about, as we think about marcus and we think about marcus as it started with one plan -- with one product. our plan has always been to build a platform, and that platform would be digital, and it would be a storefront over which we could distribute multiple products, some products that we originate and come off our platform, some products maybe that we distribute for others. there's always been a focus on the fact that we have a massive wealth management business at the very, very high end. and we've always shied away from broadening that footprint or making it more retail, for another lack of term, because the only way you could do that previously was to basically own a big brokerage. and there were a lot of reasons why we didn't think, for us, that owning a big brokerage was something that we wanted to do as we thought strategically going forward about where the firm would go. but now with a digital platform, we have opportunities to acquire clients and feed clients into our platform on a much more effective cost of customer acquisition basis. and so our vision is to continue to build out that platform and add more products and more connectivity into our wealth management business over time.\n",

      "yeah. thank you. let me start with that last part, because i think if we step back and put 2018 in perspective, there are some clear trends regarding our cost structure. starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and shipping by greater than 30%. in 2018, that number grew by 15%. certainly, unit demand was lower, but afn or amazon fulfilled demand were, we抳e combined fba and retail, remained strong. so we had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years. similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of whole foods and souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% i believe. last year, we were at 14% growth. and so, there was a lot of leverage and a lot of, in a way, there was a lot of pre hiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018, while we still continue, in some areas, especially things like our core retail business and also g&a functions, but then we continue to invest again in the technology tied to aws sales team to an aws device area. so their groups are growing considerably higher than that 14%, but on total, the company grew 14%.\n",
      "[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]\n",
      "\n",
      "sure. so first, obviously when you want a front to back and you look at your businesses, there's an element of cost-cutting and capital allocation. but the real purpose of looking at businesses front to back, the starting fundamental purpose is to understand your addressable market and the opportunity set and then with your resources to figure out the most effective way to deliver on it. so i want to be very, very clear. as any new management team would do in any large company, as they start down the path of evolving a strategy, you really want to look at the opportunity you have in businesses and then your ability to deliver on those opportunities. and so at a high level, the purpose of the front to back was both opportunity and then also efficiency, as you highlight. stephen has a couple of other comments just with respect to kind of the detail.\n",

      "i'll take the stories question. one of the challenges that marketers have is keeping up where consumers are. if you think about our history, people made the shift to mobile before marketers did, and i think one of the successes we've had is we made it easier for advertisers to move into a mobile environment. and just as we did that in mobile, now we're very focused on doing that in the new things that people are doing, and stories is a big part of that, messaging will be further out, but as important as well. so i think the fact that we've already gotten 2 million advertisers to move into stories is because we've gotten better at making it easier. we launched our automatic placements and expanded it, which converts feed ads into a format that works for stories and delivers the ads wherever they'll get the best results. so our goal is to make it as easy as possible for marketers to get to the format of stories and then deliver the ads where they're going to get the best experience and the best roi. now right now, one of the interesting things about stories is there's a benefit to being an early adopter. so the pricing is really attractive. and so we think the mix shift to stories is a big opportunity for us and it's going to take time to continue to get advertisers in, but we're very happy with demand to date.\n",

      "all right. i can talk about messaging and the integration that we're thinking about, but first, we're really early in thinking through this. so there's a lot more that we need to figure out before we finalize the plans. and then, of course, this is going to be a long-term project that i think will probably be to whatever extent we end up doing it in - a 2020 thing or beyond. there are a few big reasons why i'm excited about this and think it'll be good for the user experience, which is the reason that we're doing it. i mean, part of the question was about a commercial benefit, but that really isn't the big focus here. the first reason that i'm excited about this is moving more to end-to-end encryption by default in more of our products. people really like this in whatsapp. i think it's the direction that we should be going in with more things in the future. and i think if there's an opportunity to use the work that we've done with whatsapp there, rather than doing it in different ways in the different messaging experiences, to have that really just - to have encryption work in a consistent way across the different things that we're doing. there are also a number of cases that we see where people tell us that they want to be able to message across the different services.\n",

      "so one example is a lot of people, hundreds of millions of people, are using marketplace on facebook now, and a lot of people are using that in countries where whatsapp is the primary messaging app that they use. so we have these experiences today where we're building marketplace and you go to message someone to buy something. and the link to basically do the messaging is over messenger, but in that country, where people really want to be using it, is whatsapp and we need to make it so that people can communicate across the different networks and graphs that they have or be able to do that integration better in order to facilitate more transactions and connections there. another example is there are tens of millions of people, maybe more, but i'll go with that, who, on android, use messenger as not only their app for facebook messaging but also for sms, as their sms client. and going back to the encryption point from before, we think that there's an opportunity to, when you're going to go message someone over a phone number network, have that primarily go over whatsapp and be end-to-end encrypted rather than go over sms where it's unencrypted and less secure. so i can give you a few more examples like that, but i guess the way that i'm thinking about this is that there's a handful of cases that people are telling us that they want to be able to integrate and communicate more easily across the networks. i think moving more towards end-to-end encryption and improving security there is the right direction to go in. there's a lot of questions there that we need to work through. so we're working through this in a deliberative way. and i wouldn't expect anything here to launch soon, but this is definitely something that we're thinking about and that i think will improve the user experience.\n",

      "your execution is really differentiated. we have a very, very strong client franchise business, but's it's in a business where there's been fundamental change and wallet change. i would highlight that if you go back and look at our wallet market shares before the financial crisis in 2005, '06 and '07, our wallet shares were in the 8%, 8.5% range. and if you look at our wallet shares today, our wallet shares are around 12%. and so there was an aberration during the 2009 kind of period where the wallet shares peaked, but we've continued to build this franchise, and we're laser focused on building it. the one thing that i said in my comments that i just want to reiterate is we accept the size of the wallet share that exists, and it's our job to run the business well based on that wallet share to allocate capital over time efficiently and to run that business in an effective way from a cost perspective, and we continue to do that while continuing to invest in the client franchise. and so stephen, i think, will make some comments to add on some of the more specific detailed parts of the question.\n",

      "in fact, if you look at over the last several years, 3 to 5 years, there has been a lot of work on going inside the business to reduce expenses by about 30% in that period, reduce rwas by about 40% in that period. and most importantly, an active and engaged move to reallocate capital around the firm, moving it away from a smaller business in ficc and putting it against investment banking or other businesses around the firm. and so while we have not sort of put as much headline to a lot of that activity as perhaps some of the other institutions, this is an evolutionary process that we've begun. it now has a greater sense of urgency and purpose in the context in which david described it, and i think we have a clear view, along with those running the business, about how to get to the right place and the right size of input allocation to the business itself.\n",
